#### Some of my past projects.

* #### Birds need attention too.

	 We performed comparative analysis between Transformer ([AST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01778)) and Convolution ([EfficientNet](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/05/efficientnet-improving-accuracy-and.html)) based backbones for BirdCLEF 2022's Bird Sound classification Task. This was done for [Prof Danna Gurari's Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/Courses/NeuralNetworksAndDeepLearning/AboutCourse.html) Course in Spring 22.

* #### [Devopedia's cms-maker](https://github.com/DevopediaOrg/cms-maker/)
    Method and utilities to generate Chicago Manual Style citations from webpages for [Devopedia.org](https://devopedia.org)   

* #### [Movie Recommend](https://github.com/Abhishek-P/movie-recommend)
    Recommending movies from MovieLens dataset the way google used to recommend videos before deep learning methods.
