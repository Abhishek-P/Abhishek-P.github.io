* I will be a Masters student in Computer Science at the [University of Colorado, Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) from Fall 2021. I plan to immerse in Natural Language Processing (hopefully research) during this time. It has great faculty, researchers and grad students in the area, a non validated summary can be found [here](https://bit.ly/nlp-cub).
  
* For four years (2017 to 2021), I worked in Horizon Cloud Service at VMware. My work was focused on building and maintaining features and microservices for the Cloud Control Plane. I have been a proud part of it's evolution since and the customers' journey with it.
Things I had worked on during that time were
    * Horizon Cloud on Azure
    * Support for Monitoring and Management of Horizon 7 pods from Cloud Administration Console
    * Multi Pod Assignments with Universal Broker for Horizon 7 and Horizon Cloud on Azure
    * [Transition Process from Single-Pod Broker to Universal Broker](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Cloud-Service/services/hzncloudmsazure.admin15/GUID-B27B57CF-2A08-4315-8444-E04E3946B676.html)
    
* I was a Software Engineering Intern with Juniper Networks India for the first six months of 2017. I worked on various things to assist the work done by the JUNOS Kernel team in Bangalore.
