> "We are like dwarfs sitting <b>on the shoulders of giants</b>. We see more, and things that are more distant, than they did, not because our sight is superior or because we are taller than they, but because they raise us up, and by their great stature add to ours."

# About Me
Hi! I am a computer science researcher, primarily in the field of natural language processing. I will be starting my PhD at Georgetown University in Fall 2024. I will be working with [Prof. Nathan Schneider](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/) and other *excellent* folks of [NERT](http://nert.georgetown.edu/), [GUCL](https://gucl.georgetown.edu/), and [CS](https://cs.georgetown.edu/#). Before this, I was a master's student at CU Boulder, working with [Prof. Katharina Kann](https://kelina.github.io) and the [NALA Group](https://nala-cub.github.io/).


# Languages 
[Luke Gessler](https://web.archive.org/web/20231012014722/https://lgessler.com/) says that "*linguists [are often asked](https://specgram.com/CLXXV.1/03.carlson.cartoon5.html) how many languages they speak*" and now that I will be in the company of a bunch of them, so here are mine: [Kannada(kan)](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kan/)(native, ~B1 level), [Hindi(hin)](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hin/)(intermediate, ~B1 level), [English(eng)](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/eng/)(professional, ~C1 level), bits and pieces of [Spanish(spa)](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/spa/)(~17k Duolingo XP). 
My next language goals are to be able to converse in Spanish and to read [Konkani(kok)](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kok/) with Kannada script. 

Similarly, if you ask me how many programming languages I can program in, like I tell my students "*it's not about the number of programming language(s), it's about the [principles](https://csci3155.cs.colorado.edu/f22/syllabus.html)*" but then go on to to say I have programmed in many languages: Python (research and tooling), Java (enterprise cloud software), Scala (TAing and side projects, linkedin assessment), C (let's say structs and pointers), Javascript (up to JQuery, +Angular, Node), Kotlin (graduate software engineering project).
My next programming language target is [Julia](https://julialang.org/), which I hope to make my go-to for numerical computations and visualization (for the near future).
