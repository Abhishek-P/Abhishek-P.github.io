* ### Artificial Intelligence
    It is becoming a strong presence in our life if it has not already. I try to keep up with the developments through various means. I am more interested in **Natural Language Processing** slice of the domain and follow developments keenly.

* ### Privacy and Computer Security
    We do live on the internet significantly, from social media to online stores. We also provide information about ourselves consciously or unconsciously to service providers and other players. There are real privacy and security concerns that come with it and I think it is essential for us to stay informed.
    I admire [Mozilla's](mozilla.org/) work in this and encourage more people to subscribe to it's newsletters and listen to episodes of  it's [podcast](https://irlpodcast.org) and those with means to donate, to do so.


While we are here, I would also like to say kudos to [TED-Ed](https://ed.ted.com). I consume their video lessons focused for children :D and recommend it to children and adults alike.
