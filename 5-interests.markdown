My primary research interests are in **Natural Language Processing**. During my Masters at CU Boulder, I am working with NALA Group on research in Multilingual NLP and Cross-lingual Transfer.

* ### Artificial Intelligence
    It is becoming a strong presence in our life if it has not already. I try to keep up with the developments through various means. I still feel some surprise and worry with the ever increasing applications of AI going out into the world.


* ### Software Design and Development
    My not so short tenure at VMware gave me an appreciation for good design and healthy respect for the design tradeoffs that software developers have to do everyday. I am always curious how people approach and solve them day in and day out.

* ### Privacy and Computer Security
    We do live on the internet significantly, from social media to online stores. We also provide information about ourselves consciously or unconsciously to service providers and other players. There are real privacy and security concerns that come with it and I think it is essential for us to stay informed.
    I admire [Mozilla's](mozilla.org/) work in this and encourage more people to subscribe to it's newsletters and listen to episodes of it's [podcast](https://irlpodcast.org) and those with means, to donate.
