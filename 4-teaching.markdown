I have fortunately and somewhat surprisingly come to love teaching Computer Science in Higher Education. I hope to continue this for the foreseeable future and hopefully beyond.

* #### Graduate Teaching Assistant for [CSCI 3155: Principles of Programing Languages](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/teaching/ppl_class_notes.html) in Spring 22.
  - The Instructors were [Prof. Sriram Sankaranarayanan](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams) and [Prof. Gowtham Kaki](https://gowthamk.github.io/).


    You can find the Prof. Sankaranarayanan's notes for it at this [link](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/teaching/). I personally found it refreshing and well crafted. The course uses [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) as the primary programming medium. The course utilizes a small representative programming language called Lettuce to understand and demonstrate the principles.


* #### Graduate Teaching Assistant for [CSCI 3155: Principles of Programing Languages](https://csci3155.cs.colorado.edu/s18/) in Fall 22.
  - The Instructor is [Prof. Evan Chang](https://plv.colorado.edu/bec/).

    This is a more project/lab-driven course, but was the foundation of Prof Sriram's version of the course.
    You can choose to base your course on the same. You can find many of the resources at this [link](https://github.com/csci3155).


I strongly appreciate the efforts of the CS Department and other entities at CU Boulder that encourage and support Graduate students in pursuing teaching opportunities during their Graduate studies.
