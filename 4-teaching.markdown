* #### Graduate Teaching Assistant for [CSCI 3155: Principles of Programing Languages](https://csci3155.cs.colorado.edu/s18/), Spring 2022
  If you are someone interested in Computer Science or have taken a course on this topic, I would suggest checking out notes [here](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/teaching/), I personally found it refreshing and well crafted. The course uses [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) to teach students the principles. The students even create a toy language called Lettuce.
