* #### Graduate Teaching Assistant for [CSCI 3155: Principles of Programing Languages](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/teaching/ppl_class_notes.html) in Spring 22.
  - The Instructors were [Prof. Sriram Sankaranarayanan](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams) and [Prof. Gowtham Kaki](https://gowthamk.github.io/).


    You can find the Prof. Sankaranarayanan's notes for it [here](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/teaching/). I personally found it refreshing and well crafted. The course uses [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) as the primary programming medium. The course utilizes a Toy language called Lettuce to understand and demonstrate the principles.


* #### Graduate Teaching Assistant for [CSCI 3155: Principles of Programing Languages](https://csci3155.cs.colorado.edu/s18/) in Fall 22.
  - The Instructor is [Prof. Evan Chang](https://plv.colorado.edu/bec/).

    This is a more project/lab-driven course, but was the foundation of Prof Sriram's version of the course.
