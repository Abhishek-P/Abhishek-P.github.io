### Undergraduate Studies
  I graduated with Bachelor's in Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from [PES Institute of Technology (now PES University)](https://www.pes.edu/), Bangalore in 2013.
  
  
### Other courses
  * My first taste of MOOCs with [Cryptography I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) by Stanford's Dan Boneh in 2015, I highly recommend it for all students of Computer Sciences, the way it is both accessible and that you get to hear from one of the best teachers for the field is a unique experience.
  * I also completed [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning from Stanford Center for Professional Development](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n-natural-language-processing-deep-learning?courseId=11754&method=load) in 2019. The course structure and support was top-notch, including the interaction you get with fellow students in the cohort. It gave me a throwback to undergrad math and more hands-on experience with the deep learning models. But it does cost a pretty penny. Making other alternative courses better choices in most cases .
